You'll need the following packages: pytorch, opencv, tqdm, numpy and scipy. I recommend you to install them using the Anaconda python distribution.Personally, I use the Miniconda distribution available here: https://conda.io/miniconda.html

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to write a message.
